						<p> The Royal Botanic Gardens is located in Peradaniya which is very close to Kandy. The history of the Royal Botanic Gardens goes back to 1371. 
							King Wickramabahu III made a court at Peradeniya. Later, in the reign of King Kirti Sri Rajasinghe (ruled from 1747 to 1780) this was converted 
							to a Royal Garden. In 1810 under the advice of Sir Joseph Banks a garden named &#8220;Kew&#8221; was opened in Slave Island. In 1813 the garden 
							was moved to Kalutara so that economic plants could be cultivated at a larger scale. By the request of Mr. Alexander Moon, the Garden was 
							finally moved to Peradeniya in 1821 since it was found to be more favorable and better adapted for plant growth and cultivation. Today, the Royal 
							Botanical Gardens is renowned for its collection of a variety of orchids. The Botanical Garden includes more than 300 varieties of orchids, spices, 
							medicinal plants and palms trees. Attached to the Botanical Garden is the National Herbarium. The total area of the botanical garden is 147 
							acres. At 460 meters above sea level and with a 200 day annual rain fall it provides the plants with optimum conditions. The Royal Botanical 
							Garden exhibits both endemic and non endemic plants. The Botanical Garden is managed by the Division of National Botanic Gardens of the Department 
							of Agriculture.</p>
